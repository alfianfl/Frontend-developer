                        Writing and publishing scientific works for most academics (teachers, lecturers and students) 
                        is still a serious problem. Not a few Teachers and Lecturers are delayed, and their careers and 
                        ranks are hindered by the failure to fulfill these scientific publications. In fact, scientific 
                        publication is a mandatory requirement and an integral part of the continuous development 
                        of professionalism and competence of teachers and lecturers. There are also many students 
                        who are delayed, and are prevented from graduating due to the failure to fulfill these 
                        scientific publications. Even though, scientific publication is a mandatory requirement for
                         graduation from his studies. Even though in reality this element, is the most difficult for academics to fulfill compared 
                        to other elements. This is because the culture of research and writing has not flown in among academics.
